# polygrav
Numpy implementation of the polyhedral gravity algorithm from [Werner - Scheeres (1996)](https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/BF00053511) [1]. Given a constant-density polyhedron, the Werner - 
Scheeres formulas allow for the efficient and accurate calculation of the grativational attraction and potential at a point which is exterior to the polyhedron.
